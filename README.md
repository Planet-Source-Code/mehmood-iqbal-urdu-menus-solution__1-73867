<br>Another solution for Urdu Programming ! This is the first Solution for making Urdu Menus in VB6. There is a example code of Urdu Menus on VB6 forms, you can understand by this code that how you can make Urdu Menus & deal with them.Two things are shown in the project, 1> How to make Top menu of the form, 2> How to make right click menu & appearance of that menu with 'Click & MouseOver' events. MS Form 2.0 Object Library again used in this project. There was no special need to use that object library but used because i think, that library objects are more reliable for Urdu programming because of there extra & specialized properties. No external source needed to make Urdu Menus. Checkout, I hope you all will like this Solution. Like before, Waiting for you Feedback at my E-Mail Address. Thank You.</br>
